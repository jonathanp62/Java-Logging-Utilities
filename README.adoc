Logging-Utilities
-----------------

A library that contains logging utility classes that replace the need for the SLF4J extension package.

Static Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following static classes are provided that mimic the behaviors of the SLF4J extension classes. However, most of the classes below simply return formatted strings and do not perform logging. The throwing method that takes a Logger does perform logging.

* catching
* entry
* entryWith
* exit
* exitWith
* throwing

Unit Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The unit tests were originally written using JUnit 4 but as a demonstration and model were also re-written using JUnit 5. Both test classes are provided and the JUnit 4 tests are run by the JUnit vintage engine.

Current version: 1.3.0.
